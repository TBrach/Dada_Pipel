### Summary: Not sure I want to use merge_samples, but can be used to add up abundances within samples

######### merge_taxa
### also note: agglomeration functions tip_glom or tax_glom that merge similar OTUs based on a phylogenetic or taxonomic threshold

# could not get the closedls

## you can selectively choose which taxa to merge!
x1 = merge_taxa(closedps, taxa_names(closedps)[3:27], 2)

## but how to merge based on taxonomic rank
## SEE tax_glom and tip_glom here, (in Preprocessing tutorial)

######### merge_phyloseq
# see tutorial, is to add for example sample data, but you could always construct a completely new object
