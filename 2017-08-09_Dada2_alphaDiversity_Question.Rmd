title: "In dada2 default data (i.e. pooled = FALSE) richness (alpha diversity) correlates with total amplicons but rarefaction curves plateau early because the data usually contains almost no singletons. How to correctly correct for this effect?"

We would like to discuss how best to correct richness/alpha diversity for differences in sequencing depth (total amplicons) when using the default dada2 pipeline, i.e. when using dada(, pooled = FALSE) (<https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/pool.html>).
We generally observe in our dada2 generated count tables (seqtab) a clear trend of increasing richness with increasing number of total amplicons per sample. 
This is not surprising or unexpected in itself.
However, the dada2-generated count tables usually contain virtually no singletons. In consequence rarefaction curves plateau at a low sequencing depth that is usually well below the lowest number of amplicons of any sample in the dataset. This would indicate that there should be no correlation between richness and total number of amplicons within the range of sequencing depths we are working with. Yet the trend is clearly present. In other words, there is a correlation between richness and sequencing depth, but rarefaction can not correct for it.

To illustrate, here are plots from a study that compared the gut microbiome of two groups of mice. The groups are not necessary to illustrate the general point we would like to discuss, but they help illustrating the difference between dada(, pooled = FALSE) and dada(, pooled = TRUE).

With dada(, pooled = FALSE) we have a clear trend of increasing richness with increasing number of total amplicons. Group 2 (grp2) samples have higher richness, but have also been sequenced deeper (higher number of total amplicons).

Rarefaction curves plateau very early indicating little or no increase in richness above 10,000 amplicons (of note, the sample with lowest sequencing depth had 27648 total amplicons).

As a comparison, the same samples were run with dada(, pooled = TRUE). Here are singletons in the count table and rarefaction curves do not saturate.

Since rarefaction does not correct for the possible confounding of sequencing depth when working with dada(,pooled = FASLE) data, we would like to discuss options to do so.
Three suggestions we have come up with:

- running dada( pooled = TRUE) and check if richness trends (e.g. comparison between groups) hold also for pooled data. 
    - This is computationally challenging and not really feasible for larger datasets.
- rarefying already at the filtered reads stage and run dada( pooled = FALSE) (for richness/alpha diversity analyses only)
- run dada(, pooled = FALSE) and test for richness trends with correction for total amplicons e.g. lm(richness ~ group + total_amplicons)

Thanks in advance for any thoughts and/or explanations.
